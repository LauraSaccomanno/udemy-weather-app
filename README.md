This project is based on the creation of a Weather App with Node.js. To get real-time weather information, the Weather App uses the platform [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/).

The use of the application is simple: you write the desired location in a text box, then the necessary information is retrieved from the server and shown on a card. The weather information I used was: temperature, weather description, location, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, humidity, wind speed, sunrise and sunset.
